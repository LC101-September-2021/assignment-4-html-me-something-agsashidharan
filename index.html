      <a name="anchor-point1"><h2>Over 2 Million People Signed Up For the Event</h2></a>
      <p>More than 2 million people responded "going" and 1.5 million "interested" in the two months prior to the scheduled date. Although the organizer eventually called the â€œStorm Area 51" event a hoax and disavowed responsibility for any casualties had there been any actual attempt to raid the military base, city officials estimated that 30,000 to 40,000 people could possibly still show up to Area 51.

      <a name="anchor-point2"><h2>Nearby Hotels Are Overbooked and Flights to Nevada are Sold Out</h2></a>
      <p>The small towns near Area 51 were not prepared for the viral attention they suddenly started receiving. Small hotels started to become fully booked and overbooked for the dates surrounding the event. Flights to Nevada soon became reserved as millions of people were considering how they can attend the event. Lots of people thought of it as a funny idea to go there, but a some people actually did it.

      <a name="anchor-point3"><h2>150 People Showed Up</h2></a>

      <p>The crowd that arrived at the desert did not live up to the turnout that they hoped on. Still, the celebratory alien-seekers, some of which wore tin foil hats, chanted about aliens and had a live-streamed party at the front gates of the Air Force base.
